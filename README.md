Yii2 Babel Fish
===============
The Yii2 Babelfish symbiote is a portal to edit and update translations.


Key Features
------------

* Uses it's own database for RBAC and user identities that can be shared across multiple instances of babelfish, allowing for easy translator management for several applications in one spot.

* Uses AdminLTE and Redactor for an intuitive user experience
